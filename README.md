## ipreg
ipreg allows you to keep track of who is using what IP addresses in a lab
network. ipreg will periodically scan the network for which IPs are in
use, and let users claim addresses via a web interface. This is useful
in small research envrionments where everyone has access to a subnet
and is constantly bring up / tearing down machines.

Work in progress: This is my projec to learn go.
